Wave Motion – a Fundamental Concept of Nature. Predicting the propagation of
wave energy for high-frequency waves is a challenging task of fundamental
importance in many engineering applications. These range from acoustics and
vibrations in complex built-up structures such as cars and airplanes – think
noise – to modelling electromagnetic radiation in the radio to the infrared
spectrum with applications in telecommunication and heat transfer. The Wave
Modelling Research Group at the University of Nottingham uses advanced
mathematical tools from wave asymptotics to wave chaos theory to solve
engineering wave problems in an interdisciplinary collaboration between
colleagues from the School of Mathematical Sciences, the George Green Institute
for Electromagnetics Research, the Institute for Aerospace Technology, the
Composites Research Group and the School of Physics and Astronomy.
