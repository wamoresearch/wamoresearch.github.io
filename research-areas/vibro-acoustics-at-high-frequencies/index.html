    <section id="overview"><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Modelling and simulation is becoming ever more important in designing mechanical
structures –such as cars, airplanes or ships. Both the static and dynamic
properties, but also the interaction of a structure with the surrounding
environment – be it aerodynamic properties or crash behaviour – is now routinely
investigated through simulations. Virtual testing has thus become an essential
part of the design cycle. In particular, the Finite Element Method (FEM) is used
universally across industries and a range of sophisticated commercial software
tools exist. There is also a need for modelling <em>noise and vibration</em> in the
mid-to-high frequency regime, mostly for passenger safety and comfort. However,
a straightforward application of FEM at high frequencies (starting for cars
typically between 500Hz and 1kHz) is problematic as results become unreliable
and the model sizes become prohibitively large. A new dynamical theory —
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_energy_analysis">Dynamical Energy Analysis (DEA)</a> – can deal with the
full complexity of the structure on a reasonable computational time scale and
has the potential to make a full ray tracing approach viable for modelling
structure-borne vibrations including reflection, transmission and shell effects.
Integral formulations for the propagation of ray densities are thus becoming an
interesting alternative to statistical approaches such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_energy_analysis">Statistical
Energy Analysis (SEA)</a> or similar Power
Balance Methods due to their ability to work directly on FE-meshes – with a
resulting ease of implementation. However, there is plenty of ground to cover
before this method has been fully developed and its potential for applications
has been exhausted.</p>
</section><section id="dea-numerical-implementation"><h2>DEA – Numerical Implementation</h2>
<p>In 2009 new approach called Dynamical Energy Analysis (DEA) has been proposed in
Nottingham determining the distribution of mechanical and acousticwave energy in
complex built-up structures. The technique interpolates between standard
Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) and full ray tracing containing both these
methods as limiting cases. By writing the flow of ray trajectories in terms of
linear phase space operators, it is suggested to reformulate ray-tracing
algorithms in terms of boundary operators containing only short ray segments.
SEA can now be identified as a low-resolution, ray-tracing algorithm and typical
SEA assumptions can be quantified in terms of the properties of the ray
dynamics. The new technique enhances the applicability of standard SEA
considerably by systematically incorporating dynamical correlations wherever
necessary. Some of the inefficiencies inherent in typical ray-tracing methods
can be avoided using only a limited amount of the geometrical ray information.
The new dynamical theory thus provides a universal approach towards determining
wave energy distributions in complex structures in the high-frequency limit.</p>

<p>Simulations of the vibro-acoustic performance of automobiles are routinely
carried out in various design stages. To understand the transmission of
structure-borne sound in cars, it is necessary to have effective and efficient
modelling tools to support the structural design process ideally before a
prototype vehicle is built. The major difficulty in modelling structure-borne
sound lies in the complex geometry of the car structure. The Finite Element
Method (FEM) can describe geometric details of the car structure with sufficient
accuracy in the low frequency region, typically below 500 Hz. High frequency
analysis using FEM requires extremely fine meshes of the body structure to
capture the shorter wavelengths and, at the current time, such analysis poses
significant computational challenges. Dynamical Energy Analysis (DEA) combined
with the Discrete Flow Mapping technique (DFM) has recently been introduced as a
mesh-based high frequency method modelling structure borne sound for complex
built-up structures. This has proven to enhance vibro-acoustic simulations
considerably by making it possible to work directly on existing finite element
meshes, circumventing time-consuming and costly re-modelling strategies. In
addition, DFM provides detailed spatial information about the vibrational energy
distribution within a complex structure in the mid-to-high frequency range.
Progress in the development of the DEA method towards handling complex
FEM-meshes including Rigid Body Elements has been achieved. In addition,
structure borne transmission paths due to spot welds have been considered.</p>

<p>Composites have superior structural characteristics compared to steel or
aluminium, but can exhibit poorer dynamic and acoustic performance levels. The
study of the acoustic transmission in such structures helps to understand how to
reduce the noise footprint on aircrafts, for example. Existing methods of
analysis such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Statistical Energy Analysis
(SEA) suffer from limitations when used for modelling geometrically complex
structures in the high frequency regime. In that regard, a new method – Dynamic
Energy Analysis (DEA) in the form of Discrete Flow Mapping is used for
high-frequency vibration analysis of aircraft panels. Aircraft panels consist of
elements that can be modelled as waveguides such as plates and cylinders coupled
together through different types of joints. The coupling is represented in terms
of reflection/transmission matrices that can be obtained by solving the wave
equation numerically using the Wave Finite Element method (WFE). Then, by
incorporating WFE coupling models into the DEA method we compute the acoustic
energy distribution within the structure.</p>

<p>In the mid-to-high frequency regime, ray tracing in the form of DEA propagation
is well suited for capturing the distribution of vibroacoustic energy in complex
built-up structures. However, the effects of curvature can only be treated
approximately. We present a method here that captures wave effects in a
ray-tracing treatment on curved plates. The equations of a ray dynamics for
energy transport on arbitrarily curved and inhomogeneous smooth thin shells
canbe obtained via the Eikonal approximation from the underlying wave equations.
We analyse mid-frequency effects below the ring frequency of curved plates for a
cylindrical region smoothly connected to two flat plates using Donnell shell
theory. We perform ray tracing based on Hamilton’s equations derived in the
short wavelength regime for bending, shear and pressure incident waves. Rays
incident on the curved shell struc-ture may be reflected or transmitted. Simple
ray tracing gives either total reflection or total transmission; the solution of
the full wave equations shows in contrast a smooth transition and exhibits
resonant states in the waist of the cylindrical region. In one-dimension, both
the smooth transition and the resonant states can be treated using the
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation extended to complex rays. We use
graph models to account for resonant tunnelling in such curved plates. For
classically transmitted bending rays, we find complex rays which connect them to
the resonant states that are formed in the curved region. Similarly, for
classically reflected rays, we identify those complex rays that connect to the
phase space of transmitting trajectories. We successfully find a theoretical
expression for calculating the scattering matrix for bending rays which accounts
for resonant tunnelling mediated by resonant states. Our model agrees well with
full wave solutions.</p>

<p>Vibrational and acoustic energy distributions of wave fields in the high-
frequency regime are often modeled using flow transport equations. In real live
applications, the flow of rays or non-interacting particles is often driven by
an uncertain force or velocity field and the dynamics are determined only up to
a degree of uncertainty. A boundary integral equation description of wave energy
flow along uncertain trajectories in finite two-dimensional domains has been
developped, which is based on the truncated normal distribution, and
interpolates between a deterministic and a completely random description of the
trajectory propagation. The properties of the Gaussian probability density
function appearing in the model are applied to derive expressions for the
variance of a propagated initial Gaussian density in the weak noise case.
Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate these findings and to study
the properties of the stationary density, which is obtained in the limit of
infinitely many reflections at the boundary.</p>
