 Overview
==========

High frequency asymptotics – often also called semiclassical approximations in a
quantum context – deals with understanding the transition from a wave to a ray
description of linear wave equations. Examples are the relation between ray and
wave optics or identifying the classical equations of motion (Hamilton’s
equations) as a limiting case of quantum mechanics. In the last few decades, the
interest shifted here towards relating the solutions of linear wave equations to
the *dynamical properties* of the underlying ray dynamics. It could be shown
that dynamical features ranging from regular to purely chaotic behaviour leave
distinct fingerprints in the solutions of associated wave equations. These can
be divided into systems specific contributions relating a ray dyanmics to
particular wave solutions and universal features linking wav fluctuations to
`Random Matrix statistics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_matrix>`_. The
theory has initially mainly advanced in a quantum context giving rise to the
name `quantum chaos <http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Quantum_chaos>`_.
Schrödinger’s equation is a scalar, linear wave equation and is in that respect
not very different from other physically relevant wave equations such as in
optics or linear elasticity. The ‘weirder’ properties of quantum mechanics, as
for example, the measurement process or many-particle effects and the violation
of Bell’s inequalities have in fact rarely been considered in semiclassical
approaches to quantum mechanics until recently. In that sense, techniques and
insights from quantum chaos can and have been applied to classical wave
equations such as in optics, elastodynamics or acoustics giving rise to a much
broader field often referred to as **wave chaos**. In fact, many of the methods
and concepts used and developed in quantum chaos have been considered
independently in the optics and engineering community, and developments have run
in parallel often with little cross fertilization.

 Random Coupling Model And Wave Statistics
===========================================

Increasingly complex scenarios in electronics and telecommunications make the
detail ofstructures and circuitry ever more difficult to model. In addition, it
is often found in optics, electronics, and acoustics that, the need for higher
bit-rates pushes wave sources to emit at very short wavelengths compared to the
characteristics size of the excited system. In this regime, the scattering
process can be very sensitive to details. The complex boundary shape of an
enclosure can lead to the phenomenon of ray chaos in which a ray trajectory
inside the enclosure shows strong sensitivity to initial conditions. From
experimental observations, it is known that this results in a very high
variability of wave properties of the system. A statistical approach to
understanding the short-wavelength behavior of the system then becomes
appropriate. Specifically, one can ask what the statistics of quantities of
interest are relative to a suitable random choice of the system, and this is the
goal of the RCM. The Random Coupling Model (RCM) is a statistical method that
represents scattering and impedance matrixes of ports immersed in highly
resonating cavities. The method has been successfully applied and tested in
structures whose geometry is irregular and for which the wavelength of the
excitation field is small compared to characteristic lengths scale of the
cavity. Direct illumination or specular components between ports can be included
into the RCM through Phase Space Methods. Antenna and aperture coupling,
multiply connected chaotic environments, as well as through the wall
transmission has been merged with universal statistics within the RCM, thus
extending canonical power balance methods. This allows for tackling extremely
complicated scenarios involving the coupling of an external radiation inside
cavities with arbitrary losses. Current research efforts are devoted to model
the radiation of statistical sources operating inside complex cavities through
the RCM.

 Quantum Graphs And Quantum Search
===================================

Quantum walks can provide polynomial and even exponential speed-up compared to
classical random walks and may serve as a universal computational primitive for
quantum computation. One of the most fascinating applications of quantum walks
is their use in spatial quantum search. Like Grover’s search algorithm for
searching an unstructured database, quantum walk search algorithms can achieve
up to quadratic speed-up compared to the corresponding classical search. The
group has worked both on continuous discrete quantum walks and quantum search
algorithms. It has been demonstrate that quantum searching is related to an
avoided crossing problem with a particular low density of state near the
crossing, such is for example present near the Dirac point in graphene.
Performing quantum search and quantum state transfer on graphene provides a new
way of channeling energy and information across lattices and between distinct
sites.

 Wave Chaos In Acoustics And Elasticity
========================================

Interpreting wave phenomena in terms of an underlying ray dynamics adds a new
dimension to the analysis of linear wave equations. Forming explicit connections
between spectra and wavefunctions on the one hand and the properties of a
related ray dynamics on the other hand is a comparatively new research area,
especially in elasticity and acoustics. The theory has indeed been developed
primarily in a quantum context; it is increasingly becoming clear, however, that
important applications lie in the field of mechanical vibrations and acoustics.

We provide an overview over basic concepts in this emerging field of *wave
chaos*. This ranges from ray approximations of the Green function to periodic
orbit trace formulae and random matrix theory and summarizes the state of the
art in applying these ideas in acoustics—both experimentally and from a
theoretical/numerical point of view.
